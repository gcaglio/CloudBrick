# CloudBrick
This project is intented to provide information, electronic schematics and Arduino sketches to let you build mini devices for LEGOⓇ management via MQTT broker.

# UseCase
Let's image you have some (or many) LEGOⓇ models (trains, cars and so on) and you want to drive them via your smartphone via internet.
Then you cannot rely on the LEGO Application, since you cannot manage more that one vehicle at a time, and it rely on bluetooth connection.
